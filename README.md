### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Eddie, a software engineer with a strong background in quality engineering. My interests are games, machine learning, and all things space-related. Currently studying mechanical engineering at OU with the goal of working on guidence and control systems in spacecraft. In my spare time I'm training for an Ironman 70.3 :) 

Ping me if you'd like to talk tech, or if you're working on open source code that goes into space & want a very eager contributor! 

Currently living in Palo Alto (PT) but moving to Stockholm this summer (CET).
